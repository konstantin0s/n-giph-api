# The app is build with external api (gifs api) where node.js, express.js is used in the backend as a middleware, and react.js in the front end to display the api data. The style is very minimalistic, the focus was on having a completely functional app where when a user lands for the first time can see a list of gifs on home page. There is a Giphy page where the user is able to search for its whatever gif he/she wants, the search has also suggestions. Furthermore, there is a click through one gif page. Each page has buttons with share, which means that these pages can be shared on social media: Facebook or Twitter.
1. Clone the app with: 
~ git clone     
2. Run npm install from both folders: root folder and client folder to install all the packages.
3. Add .env file into root folder with gif api key ( your own app key).
4. From root folder, run:  
~ npm run dev
